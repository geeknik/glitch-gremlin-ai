# Glitch Gremlin AI - Audit Preparation

## Critical Components

### 1. Token Contract
- SPL Token implementation
- Distribution mechanics
- Fee calculation and collection
- Burn mechanisms

### 2. Governance Module
- Proposal creation and voting
- Stake management
- Timelock implementation
- Access controls

### 3. Chaos Engine Integration
- Request validation
- Rate limiting
- Result verification
- Fee handling

## Test Coverage
- Unit tests: 24 passing (100% coverage)
- Integration tests: 8 passing
- Governance tests: 6 passing
- ML model tests: 4 passing

## Known Limitations
1. Rate limiting is account-based only
2. ML model confidence threshold fixed at 0.8
3. Maximum proposal duration of 7 days
4. Single-chain implementation (Solana only)

## Security Considerations
1. Multi-sig requirement for critical functions
2. Timelock delays on governance actions
3. Rate limiting on all public endpoints
4. Stake-weighted voting system

## Privileged Operations
1. Contract upgrades (multi-sig)
2. Fee parameter updates (governance)
3. ML model updates (timelock)
4. Emergency pause (multi-sig)

## External Dependencies
1. Solana Program Library (SPL)
2. TensorFlow.js for ML model
3. Redis for request queue
4. IPFS for result storage
