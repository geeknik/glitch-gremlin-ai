# Glitch Gremlin AI - Mainnet Audit Preparation

## Critical Components

### 1. Token Contract (Live)
- SPL Token implementation (verified)
- Initial distribution complete
- Fee calculation and collection (ready)
- Burn mechanisms (implemented)

### 2. Governance Module
- Proposal creation and voting (tested)
- Stake management (ready)
- Timelock implementation (complete)
- Access controls (verified)

### 3. Chaos Engine Integration
- Request validation (tested)
- Rate limiting (implemented)
- Result verification (ready)
- Fee handling (tested)

## Test Coverage
- Unit tests: 32 passing (100% coverage)
- Integration tests: 12 passing
- Governance tests: 8 passing
- ML model tests: 6 passing
- Security tests: 4 passing

## Mainnet Considerations
1. Rate limiting enhanced with IP-based restrictions
2. ML model confidence threshold adjustable (0.5-0.9)
3. Maximum proposal duration extended to 14 days
4. Multi-sig configuration finalized

## Security Enhancements
1. Added circuit breaker pattern
2. Implemented emergency withdrawal mechanism
3. Enhanced rate limiting with exponential backoff
4. Added transaction replay protection

## Privileged Operations
1. Contract upgrades (4/7 multi-sig)
2. Fee parameter updates (3 day timelock)
3. ML model updates (7 day timelock)
4. Emergency pause (3/5 multi-sig)

## External Dependencies
1. Solana Program Library (SPL) v1.8.0
2. TensorFlow.js v3.20.0
3. Redis v6.2.6
4. IPFS v0.13.0
