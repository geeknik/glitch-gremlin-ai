# AI-Driven Vulnerability Detection

## Overview
Glitch Gremlin uses machine learning to enhance its vulnerability detection capabilities. The ML model analyzes both static and dynamic program features to identify potential security issues.

## Features

### Static Analysis
- Code pattern recognition
- Control flow analysis
- State variable tracking
- Cross-program invocation detection

### Dynamic Analysis
- Transaction trace analysis
- Memory access patterns
- Instruction sequence modeling
- Error pattern detection

## Model Architecture

The vulnerability detection model uses a deep neural network with:
- Input layer: Dense (128 units, ReLU activation) for processing 20 program features
- Regularization: Dropout layer (0.2) to prevent overfitting
- Hidden layer: Dense (32 units, ReLU activation) for pattern recognition
- Output layer: Dense with softmax activation for multi-class vulnerability prediction

Key features:
- Input features include transaction patterns, memory access, error rates
- Confidence scoring for each prediction
- Pattern analysis for detailed vulnerability insights
- Model persistence with save/load capabilities

## Usage

```typescript
import { GlitchSDK, TestType } from '@glitch-gremlin/sdk';

const sdk = new GlitchSDK({
    cluster: 'devnet',
    wallet: yourWallet
});

// Create request with ML configuration
const request = await sdk.createChaosRequest({
    targetProgram: "Your program ID",
    testType: TestType.EXPLOIT,
    duration: 300,
    intensity: 7,
    params: {
        mlConfig: {
            confidenceThreshold: 0.8,
            featureExtraction: {
                includeStaticAnalysis: true,
                includeDynamicTraces: true
            }
        }
    }
});

// Get results with ML predictions
const results = await request.waitForCompletion();
console.log('ML Predictions:', results.mlPredictions);
```

## Model Training

The model is trained on:
- Known vulnerability patterns
- Historical exploit data
- Community-submitted test cases
- Synthetic program traces

## Confidence Scores

ML predictions include confidence scores (0-1):
- 0.9-1.0: Very high confidence
- 0.7-0.9: High confidence
- 0.5-0.7: Medium confidence
- <0.5: Low confidence

## Best Practices

1. Start with high confidence thresholds (0.8+)
2. Enable both static and dynamic analysis
3. Review ML predictions alongside traditional test results
4. Contribute validated findings back to the training dataset
